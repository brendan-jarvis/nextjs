I was curious about using Three.js to build 3D computer graphics in a web browser using WebGL.

I started this project to learn 3D graphics prompted to do so as part of a job application. It began as a simple demo, and I've since expanded it into a fully playable game.

**[Play the game here](/asteroids)** (desktop only - requires keyboard)

## Features

- Classic Asteroids gameplay with shooting, collision detection, and asteroid splitting
- Score tracking with high score persistence
- Level progression with increasing difficulty
- Retro arcade aesthetic with the Press Start 2P font

## Controls

- **Arrow Keys / WASD** - Move and rotate
- **Space** - Fire

The application uses React, Next.js, [React-Three-Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction) and [Drei](https://drei.pmnd.rs/).
