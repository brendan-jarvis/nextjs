I rebuilt this project to learn the T3 stack (TypeScript, Tailwind, TRPC, and Prisma). It also used the unstyled component library of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/).

I also used this project to improve my skills with Python. The data was collected, cleaned, and stored in a database using BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Python scripts.
